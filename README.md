New start, first web creation of my own without rules !

## 1-Intro 
The aim of this project is to show for half what are my skills, for half what is my groove.  
I could have chosen to expose my cursus homeworks with a 'portofolio' application, but I have chosen to build it with tools that I like to use,
I mean, for the backend part : Symfony 4 and for the frontend part the historical combo : HTML/CSS/Javascript.
